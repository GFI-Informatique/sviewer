sviewer
=======

Sviewer (Simple Viewer) is a very simple web map viewer working with the geOrchestra IDS and based on the OpenLayers library.
Sviewer offers basic map controls, geolocation (french geoportal based), WMS and KML layers display, permalink and QR code. 
It is touchscreen-friendly.

Sviewer was designed to work within the GeoBretagne IDS, but it also may work with any OGC-enabled IDS with minimal changes.

Sviewer comes with a "dual" viewer for map comparsion.
